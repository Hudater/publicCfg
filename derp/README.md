# NOTE: `derp.yaml` is just so that I can remember the formatting since the caps are important

### Use `derp.yaml` for private servers and keep in `$BAK_CFG_DIR` and `derpmap.json` for public servers

## `derp.yaml` is yaml listing of selected derp servers to ue alongside my embedded derp server defined in headscale's config


## `derpmap.json` is same but in json format so that I can put raw link in headscale config
